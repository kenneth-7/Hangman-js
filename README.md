A simple Hangman game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
You can enter your own words, get a random word or get a random first generation Pokemon.

I used the "Random Word API"(http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) to get the random words.
And to get the random Pokemon, I used "The RESTful Pok√©mon API" (https://pokeapi.co/).
