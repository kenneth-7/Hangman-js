# JavaScript Hangman
You can enter your own words, get a random word or get a random first generation Pokemon.

## How was it built
This was build by using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I used the [Random Word API](http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) to get the random words
and [the RESTful Pokémon](https://pokeapi.co/) API to get the random Pokemon.
